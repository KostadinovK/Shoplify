# Shoplify
A web platform for selling and buying all kind of stuff like electrical appliances, clothes, books and many more. 
Shoplify works based on the principle of advertisements, created by users. This is a platform for users to sell their stuff when they create an advertisement.  To work with Shoplify you need to register an account when you have done it you can access the home page. On it are listed some of the latest ads and you can search for an ad via the search bar or via the categories list. Ads sorting by name and price is supported. Each ad has a duration of 30 days before it will be archived automatically. An admin can archive or ban it whenever he thinks that the ad is offensive or when he accepts a report from another user. Also, admins have access to the admin panel where they can see and manage all ads, users, and reports. They can also check some charts with statistics about the usage of the app. Each normal user can create an advertisement, view ads, and write comments to them. If they like an ad, they can put it in their wishlist or directly connect with the seller via the real-time chat between users. The chatting functionality supports one chat per ad and user. Shoplify supports also notifications, each user can access his notifications. They are sent when a certain action occurs as if someone sent a message to the user or if someone comment on an ad in the user wishlist. Users can also follow other users - they will get notifications about the other user ads. Shoplify also supports ad promoting which is a paid feature when used an ad is promoted for a certain amount of time and it is always on top of all the ads in its category.
